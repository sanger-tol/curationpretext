## Introduction

**sanger-tol/curationpretext** is a bioinformatics pipeline typically used in conjunction with [TreeVal](https://github.com/sanger-tol/treeval) to generate pretext maps (and optionally telomeric, gap, coverage, and repeat density plots which can be ingested into pretext) for the manual curation of high quality genomes.

This is intended as a supplementary pipeline for the [treeval](https://github.com/sanger-tol/treeval) project. This pipeline can be simply used to generate pretext maps, information on how to run this pipeline can be found in the [usage documentation](https://pipelines.tol.sanger.ac.uk/curationpretext/usage).

<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/design_guidelines#examples for examples.   -->

1. Generate Maps - Generates pretext maps as well as a static image.

2. Accessory files - Generates the repeat density, gap, telomere, and coverage tracks.

## Usage

> **Note**
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how
> to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline)
> with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

Currently, the pipeline uses the following flags:

- `--input`

  - The absolute path to the assembled genome in, e.g., `/path/to/assembly.fa`

- `--longread`

  - The directory of the fasta files generated from longread reads, e.g., `/path/to/fasta/`

- `--longread_type`

  - The type of longread data you are utilising, e.g., ont, illumina, hifi.

- `--aligner`

  - The aligner yopu wish to use for the coverage generation, defaults to bwamem2 but minimap2 is also supported.

- `--cram`

  - The directory of the cram _and_ cram.crai files, e.g., `/path/to/cram/`

- `--map_order`

  - hic map scaffold order, input either `length` or `unsorted`

- `--teloseq`

  - A telomeric sequence, e.g., `TTAGGG`

- `-entry`
  - ALL_FILES is the default and generates all accessory files as well as pretext maps
  - MAPS_ONLY generates only the pretext maps and static images

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

#### For ALL_FILES run

```bash
nextflow run sanger-tol/curationpretext \
  --input { input.fasta } \
  --cram { path/to/cram/ } \
  --longread { path/to/longread/fasta/ } \
  --longread_type { default is "hifi" }
  --sample { default is "pretext_rerun" } \
  --teloseq { default is "TTAGGG" } \
  --map_order { default is "unsorted" } \
  --outdir { OUTDIR } \
  -profile <docker/singularity/{institute}>

```

#### For MAPS_ONLY run

```bash
nextflow run sanger-tol/curationpretext \
  --input { input.fasta } \
  --cram { path/to/cram/ } \
  --longread { path/to/longread/fasta/ } \
  --longread_type { default is "hifi" }
  --sample { default is "pretext_rerun" } \
  --teloseq { default is "TTAGGG" } \
  --map_order { default is "unsorted" } \
  --outdir { OUTDIR } \
  -profile <docker/singularity/{institute}> \
  -entry MAPS_ONLY \
```

> **Warning:**
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those
> provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
